# Computational Intelligence - Homework 2

## Ant Colony Optimization - Graph Coloring

## Particle Systems

Different sorts of modes/animations have been created in this project using particle systems, random logic and real life examples like party poppers, emitters, circular and random movements

### Paramters:

- Particle Count: 100 to 10000
- Particle Size: 2 to 15
- Particle Speed: 0.1 to 1
- Particle Lifespan: 10 to 100

### Tech Stack:

- Frontend: HTML (structuring)
- Rendering: ThreeJS (WebGL framework)
- Algorithm & Logic: JavaScript & DOM

Note:

- Particle lifespan, speed & size parameters are still random => Math.random() \* user_selected_value

## Description

- Question 1:

- Question 2:
  - index.html (contains structure of render)
  - particles.js (contains particles systems, rendering and logic(DOM) schemes)
